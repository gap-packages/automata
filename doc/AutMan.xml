The first author wishes to acknowledge Cyril Nicaud and Paulo Varandas for
their help in programming some functions of the very first version of this
package. He wishes also to acknowledge useful discussions and comments by
Cyril Nicaud, Vítor H. Fernandes, Jean-Eric Pin and Jorge Almeida.
<P/>
The first author also acknowledges support of FCT through CMUP
and the FCT and POCTI Project POCTI/32817/MAT/2000 which is funded in
cooperation with the European Community Fund FEDER.
<P/>
The third author acknowledges financial support of FCT and the POCTI program
through a scholarship given by Centro de Matemática da Universidade do Porto.
<P/>

The authors would like to thank Mark Kambites for his contribution in finding
bugs and making suggestions for the improvement of this package.
<P/>
<P/>
<P/>
Concerning the maintenance:
<P/>
<P/>
The first author was/is (partially) supported by:
<P/> the Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) project PTDC/MAT/65481/2006;
<P/> the <E>Centro de Matemática da Universidade do Porto</E> (CMUP), in particular for those periods in which CMUP was funded by
<P/> the European Regional Development Fund through the
program COMPETE and by the Portuguese Government through the FCT - Fundação
para a Ciência e a Tecnologia under the project PEst-C/MAT/UI0144/2011;
<P/> The first author wants to acknowledge partial support by CMUP (UID/MAT/00144/2013 and UID/MAT/00144/2019), which is funded by FCT (Portugal) with national (MEC) and European structural funds through the programs FEDER, under the partnership agreement PT2020.

  <Colophon>
    
This work started in 1998, when the first author was in the
LIAFA at the University of Paris 7, in a post-doc.
Encouraged by J. E. Pin, he began the implementation in &GAP;3 of
an algorithm obtained some time before to answer a question from the realm
of Finite Semigroups proposed by J. Almeida.<P/>

The first version of this package on automata was prepared by the first author
who gave it the form of a &GAP; share package.
In a second version, prepared by the first and third authors,
many functions have been added and the performance of many of the existing
ones has been improved. Further important improvements, specially concerning performance,
have been achieved when the second author joined the group.

The first author is particularly grateful to Max Horn whose help made the release of Versions 1.14 and 1.15 a lot easier. 
<P/>
<P/>
From Version 1.12, the package is maintained by the first two authors, and Ruth Hoffmann joined the maintenance team from Version 1.16.

Bug reports, suggestions and comments are welcome. Please use our
email addresses to this effect.
